# sample
Contains samples of code I have written. OvereloadedMapper uses the ChemAxon library to describe a set of Chemaxon molecules as a fake "Molecule" that branches out where the molecules differ, essentially including all of them but ensuring that they overlap in those regions they have in common.

Updater is a part of a 10-person project, the rest of which is absent from this repository. It takes in a list of instructions for lab operations (a Semiprotocol), and simulates its effects on the lab's inventory.
